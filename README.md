# Matplotlib-Challenge

This challenge examined a fictitious pharmaceutical company's study results on mice and the therapeutic use of certain regimens to shrink tumors associated with squamous cell carcinoma. Included in the challenge are:

- A full statistical analysis of the data collected
- Bar charts which show the total treatments given over the course of the study
- Pie charts which show the sex of the mice in the study
- A box plot which shows the interquartile ranges, medians, and outliers for four of the treatment regimens
- A line plot of tumor volume vs. treatment timepoint for a mouse treated with Capomulin
- A scatter plot of mouse weight vs. tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen
- A calculated correlation coefficient and linear regression model, with the linear regression equation graphed on previous scatter plot. The line equation is also given on the plot.
